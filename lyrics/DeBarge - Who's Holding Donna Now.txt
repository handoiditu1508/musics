Sometimes a love won't let go

Hard as I try I know it shows

Everybody's telling me
You'll be over her eventually
But how am I supposed to feel so secure
When I keep wonderin' who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin' who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do to be in his shoes somehow

And I keep wonderin' who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin' what magic can be found
To turn me back to the one who's holding Donna now

The letter started with goodbye

I've read it half a million times

Tell me this is just a dream
When I wake up she'll be here next to me
Tell me it will be just the way it was, oh

Well I keep wonderin' who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin' who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do to be in his shoes right now

And I keep wonderin' who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin' what magic can be found
To turn me back to the one who's holding Donna now
(Who's holding Donna now)
I keep wonderin' (who's heart she's knocking around)
There's nothing I wouldn't do to be in his shoes right now whoa, whoa

(Who's holding Donna now) oh, Donna
(What magic can be found)
To make me the one, who's holding Donna now
I can't get Donna off my mind (who's holding Donna now)
I keep wonderin' (who's heart she's knocking around)
There's nothing I wouldn't do, to be in his shoes right now
